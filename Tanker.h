/*
A Tanker is a ship with a large corgo capacity for fuel.
It can be told an Island to load fuel at, and an Island to unload at.
Once it is sent to the loading destination, it will start shuttling between 
the loading and unloading destination. At the loading destination, 
it will first refuel then wait until its cargo hold is full, then it will
go to the unloading destination.

Initial values:
fuel capacity and initial amount 100 tons, maximum speed 10., fuel consumption 2.tons/nm, 
resistance 0, cargo capacity 1000 tons, initial cargo is 0 tons.

If no protected members are shown, there must be none in your version.
